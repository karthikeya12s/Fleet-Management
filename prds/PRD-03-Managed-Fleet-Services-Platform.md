# PRD-03: Managed Fleet Services Platform for Mid-Market Companies

**Product Name:** FleetBridge
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 29, 2026
**Author:** Product Management
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Overview

FleetBridge is a managed fleet services platform that provides full-lifecycle fleet operations outsourcing for mid-market companies (50-500 vehicles) whose core business is not transportation. FleetBridge combines a technology platform (client portal, vendor management, compliance automation) with a team of fleet operations specialists who handle day-to-day fleet administration — maintenance coordination, compliance tracking, vendor management, cost optimization, and lifecycle planning — so clients can focus on their core business.

**Business Model:** Per-vehicle monthly management fee + gain-sharing on cost savings achieved.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Mid-Market Fleet Management Gap

Mid-market companies with non-core fleets face a structural management problem:

- **The "management gap":** Companies with 50-500 vehicles are too large for ad-hoc management (the office manager can't track 200 vehicles in a spreadsheet) but too small to justify a dedicated fleet department (a fleet manager + admin costs $120K-$180K/year in salary + benefits). The NAFA benchmarking survey shows companies without dedicated fleet departments **overspend by 20-30% on fleet TCO**.

- **Fleet is a distraction, not a capability:** For a pharmaceutical company, a plumbing business, or a utility contractor, vehicles are tools that enable their real work. Yet fleet administration consumes **30-40% of an operations manager's time** — time spent scheduling oil changes, tracking registration renewals, handling accident claims, reconciling fuel cards, and calling repair shops.

- **Compliance risk is existential:** A single FMCSA compliance violation (expired DOT medical card, lapsed vehicle registration, overdue inspection) can result in **$1,000-$16,000+ fines per incident**. A pattern of violations leads to DOT audits, increased insurance premiums, or loss of operating authority. Mid-market companies lack the systems and expertise to stay ahead of compliance deadlines across 50-500 vehicles.

- **Vendor fragmentation:** A 200-vehicle fleet typically works with **15-25 separate vendors** (maintenance shops, tire dealers, fuel card companies, insurance brokers, body shops, towing services, registration services, auction houses). Each vendor relationship requires management, invoicing, and quality oversight. No one person has time to optimize this.

- **No data-driven decisions:** Without fleet management software, mid-market companies lack visibility into true TCO per vehicle. They don't know when a vehicle costs more to maintain than replace. They don't benchmark fuel efficiency. They can't identify which drivers cost the most in maintenance and fuel. Decisions are made on gut feel, costing an estimated **$2,000-$5,000 per vehicle per year** in avoidable waste.

- **Enterprise solutions don't fit:** Element Fleet Management, Merchants Fleet, and ARI dominate fleet management services for large enterprises (1,000+ vehicles) with minimum fleet sizes of 200-500 vehicles and complex multi-year contracts. Mid-market companies are underserved, left with a patchwork of point solutions or doing nothing.

### Market Opportunity

- **US companies with 50-500 vehicle fleets:** ~120,000 companies operating ~12 million vehicles
- **Average fleet spend per vehicle/year:** $12,000-$18,000 (fuel, maintenance, insurance, depreciation, admin)
- **Total addressable market:** $144B-$216B in managed fleet spend
- **Management fee SAM (5-8% of fleet spend):** $7.2B-$17.3B
- **Realistic serviceable market (10% penetration):** $720M-$1.73B

## 3. Target Users & Personas

### Primary Persona: Operations Director (Reluctant Fleet Manager)

**Name:** Sarah Mitchell
**Role:** VP of Operations, regional plumbing company
**Fleet Size:** 120 service vans + 15 support vehicles
**Age:** 44
**Reports To:** CEO

**Current Situation:**
- Fleet management is 35% of her job, but not in her job description
- Has an operations coordinator who spends ~20 hours/week on fleet admin
- Uses a shared Google Sheet to track maintenance (updated inconsistently)
- Missed 3 vehicle registration renewals last quarter — 2 drivers were pulled over
- Has no idea what the fleet's true cost per mile is
- Last insurance renewal increased 22% — broker said "claims history" but she has no data to negotiate
- CEO is asking her to reduce fleet costs by 10% — she doesn't know where to start

**Goals:**
- Offload fleet administration so she can focus on operations and growth
- Eliminate compliance surprises (zero missed renewals, zero fines)
- Get clear fleet cost data for budgeting and reduction targets
- Reduce insurance premiums with better safety and maintenance records

### Secondary Persona: CFO / Controller

**Name:** David Park
**Role:** CFO, mid-size construction company
**Fleet Size:** 280 vehicles (trucks, vans, pickups, heavy equipment transporters)
**Age:** 51

**Current Pain:**
- Fleet is the #2 operating expense after labor but has the least visibility
- Cannot produce accurate fleet TCO reports for the board
- Suspects 10-15% waste in fleet spend but can't quantify it
- Fuel card reconciliation takes the AP team 3 days per month
- Vehicle disposition timing is ad-hoc — some vehicles run 50K miles past optimal replacement point
- Has been burned by managed service providers before (hidden fees, poor service)

**Goals:**
- Transparent fleet cost reporting with no surprises
- Demonstrable ROI from fleet management outsourcing within 6 months
- Predictable monthly fleet cost (budget certainty)
- Data-driven vehicle replacement decisions

### Tertiary Persona: Facilities / Administrative Manager

**Name:** Maria Gonzalez
**Role:** Office Manager, pest control company
**Fleet Size:** 65 service vehicles
**Age:** 37

**Current Pain:**
- "Fleet manager" was added to her responsibilities 2 years ago — no training
- Spends 10+ hours/week on fleet tasks she barely understands
- Doesn't know what preventive maintenance schedules should look like
- Handles accident paperwork, registration renewals, insurance certs — all manually
- Dreads the annual insurance renewal process

**Goals:**
- Someone else to handle fleet operations entirely
- Be able to answer the boss's fleet questions without hours of research
- Stop worrying about things she doesn't have expertise in

## 10. Competitive Analysis

| Capability | FleetBridge | Element Fleet | Merchants Fleet | ARI (Holman) | Donlen | Local Fleet Consultants |
|-----------|------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Target segment** | 50-500 vehicles | 500-50,000+ | 200-10,000+ | 500-20,000+ | 300-10,000+ | 10-100 vehicles |
| **Minimum fleet size** | 50 | 500 | 200 | 500 | 300 | None |
| **Monthly fee range** | $65-95/veh | $50-80/veh | $60-90/veh | $55-85/veh | $55-75/veh | Hourly consulting |
| **Technology platform** | Modern SaaS portal | Legacy + modern | Modern | Legacy (upgrading) | Moderate | None |
| **Gain-sharing model** | Yes (30/70) | Custom | Some programs | Custom | No | No |
| **Contract minimum** | 12 months | 36+ months | 24+ months | 36+ months | 24+ months | None |
| **Onboarding time** | 60 days | 90-120 days | 90 days | 90-120 days | 90 days | N/A |
| **Self-service portal** | Yes (full) | Limited | Yes | Limited | Basic | No |
| **EV transition support** | Yes (P2) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| **Mid-market focus** | Core segment | Secondary | Growing | Secondary | Secondary | Primary |

### Competitive Positioning

**FleetBridge vs. Enterprise Players (Element, ARI, Merchants):**
These players focus on 500+ vehicle fleets with multi-year contracts and legacy technology. Their service model is built for enterprise procurement processes. FleetBridge wins on: lower minimum fleet size, shorter contract terms, modern technology, faster onboarding, and transparent gain-sharing pricing. Enterprise players struggle to profitably serve 50-200 vehicle accounts.

**FleetBridge vs. Local Fleet Consultants:**
Independent fleet consultants offer expertise but not operational execution. They advise but don't coordinate vendors, process invoices, or handle compliance. FleetBridge provides both expertise and execution at scale, backed by technology.

**Key Differentiator:** The only managed fleet services provider purpose-built for mid-market companies (50-500 vehicles), combining modern technology with dedicated operations specialists and a transparent gain-sharing model aligned with client outcomes.

- Vendor performance scorecards: quality rating, turnaround time, cost competitiveness — underperformers replaced quarterly

---

## 12. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Direct Sales in Target Verticals (Months 1-8)

**Target Industries (initial):**
1. **HVAC / Plumbing / Electrical** — service vans, high maintenance needs, compliance-sensitive
2. **Construction** — mixed fleets, high vehicle costs, safety-critical
3. **Pharmaceutical / Medical device sales** — car fleets for reps, appearance-sensitive, high compliance
4. **Pest control / Landscaping** — route-based fleets, high wear-and-tear

**Sales Motion:**
1. Identify companies with 50-300 vehicles via LinkedIn Sales Navigator, industry association member lists, fleet registration data
2. Target VP Operations, COO, or CFO (not fleet managers — these companies don't have one)
3. Lead with "free fleet assessment" (2-week analysis of current fleet data → produce savings estimate)
4. Present: "Here's what you're spending, here's what you should be spending, here's how FleetBridge closes the gap"
5. Pilot option: 90-day managed service for a subset (25-50 vehicles) with clear ROI metrics
6. Full fleet conversion after pilot proves value

**Sales Team (Y1):** 3 account executives (AE), 2 SDRs, 1 VP Sales
**Average deal cycle:** 45-90 days
**Target close rate:** 20% of qualified opportunities

### Phase 2: Industry Association & Referral Channel (Months 6-14)

- **Trade association partnerships:** Sponsor events at PHCC (plumbing), ACCA (HVAC), ABC (construction) conferences
- **Accounting firm referrals:** Partner with regional CPA firms that serve mid-market companies — fleet cost reduction is a natural advisory topic
- **Insurance broker referrals:** Brokers recommend FleetBridge to improve clients' fleet safety profiles (lower premiums = happier clients = retained policies)
- **Referral program:** $2,000 per referred client that signs (paid to referrer after 90 days)

### Phase 3: Geographic Expansion & Scale (Months 12-24)

- **Phase 1 geography:** Southeast US (Florida, Georgia, Carolinas, Tennessee) — high fleet density, favorable business environment
- **Phase 2 geography:** Texas, Midwest — expand vendor network, hire local FOS teams
- **Phase 3 geography:** Northeast, West Coast — full national coverage
- **Virtual operations model:** FOS team works remotely; vendor coordination is phone/digital; no need for FleetBridge offices in every market

## 13. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Vendor quality inconsistency** across geographies | High | High | Rigorous vendor vetting process; scorecards with quarterly reviews; minimum 3 vendors per service category per metro; rapid vendor replacement SOP |
| **Scaling FOS team** — hiring and training fleet operations specialists | Medium | High | Structured 6-week training program; hire from fleet management, auto dealership service, and insurance claims backgrounds; documented SOPs for all workflows |
| **Client churn if cost savings not realized** | Medium | High | 90-day baseline assessment sets realistic expectations; gain-sharing aligns incentives; quarterly business reviews with transparent reporting |
| **Compliance failure** (missed deadline) | Low | Critical | Triple-redundancy: automated system alerts + FOS calendar + weekly compliance audit; $5,000 penalty cap to client if FleetBridge misses a deadline |
| **Enterprise competitors move downmarket** | Medium | Medium | Move fast to build mid-market brand and client base; superior technology and onboarding speed are defensible; enterprise players can't profitably serve this segment with their cost structure |
| **Economic downturn reduces client fleet sizes** | Medium | Medium | Managed services value prop strengthens during downturns (cost reduction urgency); flexible contract terms allow fleet-size adjustments |

## Appendix A: Key Assumptions

1. Mid-market companies (50-500 vehicles) will outsource fleet management when presented with clear ROI (12-20% cost savings)
2. One Fleet Operations Specialist can effectively manage 300-400 vehicles across 2-3 accounts
3. Vendor negotiation leverage (aggregated volume across clients) can deliver 8-15% below retail pricing
4. 90-day baseline TCO assessment is sufficient to set gain-sharing benchmarks
5. Virtual/remote FOS model works — no need for on-site fleet staff at client locations
6. 70% of managed service value can be delivered through the first 3 services (maintenance, compliance, vendor management)

## Appendix B: Open Questions

1. Should we offer a "technology-only" tier (self-service portal without managed operations) for price-sensitive prospects?
2. How do we handle clients whose fleet spans 20+ states — registration and compliance complexity scales significantly?
3. Should we build or buy the operations management platform (build = customized, buy = faster launch with Fleetio/Fleet Maintenance Pro)?
4. What is the optimal FOS-to-vehicle ratio by fleet complexity tier (light-duty service vans vs. Class 8 trucks)?
5. Should we take on vehicle procurement as a P0 service, or defer to reduce operational complexity at launch?
